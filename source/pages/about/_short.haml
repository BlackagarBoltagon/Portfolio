        Hello, my name is Mariusz and I'm a web &amp; mobile interactive designer as well
        as front-end web developer. I have been around for a while and I worked with
        variety of clients - from startups to corporations and governments.

        I have experience with logo design, interaction and user interface design and
        front-end web development and I have been working with PHP, Rails, Django, 
        Node.js, iOS and Android. Since I understand the development process, I can 
        work side by side with your developers to deliver products that your customers 
        will love.
