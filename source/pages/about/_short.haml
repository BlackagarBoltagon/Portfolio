        I'm a self-taught digital product designer based in Berlin, firmly believing that
        design is first and foremost about visual problem solving. This is why I dedicated
        my career to working closely alongside great companies, making sure we deliver
        delight to the customers at every step of their interaction with their brand and
        product.

        I will work closely with your team, your customers and your stakeholders 
        to make sure that we deliver exactly what they need, while keeping an eye
        on your business goals & objectives.

        For over ten years I have been working with all sorts of teams and doing all sorts
        of jobs, from user research to managing design teams, to make sure I understand the entire
        lifecycle of the product and can deliver anything your team needs - from ideas,
        concepts and sketches to working prototypes that you can test with your customers.
