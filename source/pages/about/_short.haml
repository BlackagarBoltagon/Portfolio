        I'm a self-taught digital product designer based in Berlin, firmly believing that
        design is a way to solve business problems, rather than putting icing on a cake. 
        This is why I work closely with your team, your customers and your stakeholders 
        to make sure that we deliver delight to your users while keeping an eye
        on what you want to achieve as a business.

        For over ten years I have working with all sorts of teams and doing all sorts
        of jobs, from user research to managing design teams, to make sure I understand the entire
        lifecycle of your project and can deliver anything your team needs - from concept 
        sketches to testable prototypes.

        If this sounds exciting, [get in touch](/contact.html).
